### Aspects to be evaluated

- Documentation of the project. You have the opportunity to show here how organized you are. Don't miss the opportunity ðŸ˜‰.
- How you handle the API requests and the data that you get from them.
- The management of the data and the state of the application. You can use the tool that feels more comfortable, whatever it is Context API, Redux, Recoil, etc. But show understanding of their concepts.
- A small demonstration of testing. It's not necessary to test all the components, but at least show how you would test a component or a hook.
- Extra points if you implement a simple auth formulary, doesn't matter if it's with dummy data, but implement good practices of forms validation.
