# Frontend Technical Assessment

FinSphera Frontend Technical Assessment.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Part 1. Develop a small application.

A movie landing page that shows a list of movies and their details. You can use the movie database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to get the data or any other API of your preference.

### Aspects to be evaluated

- The correct handling of git workflow, good organization of the commits and the branches.
- The quality of the code, following the best practices and the patterns of the language.
- The quality of the user interface, the user experience and the responsiveness of the application it's a crucial aspect.
- Documentation of the project. You have the opportunity to show here how organized you are. Don't miss the opportunity ðŸ˜‰.
- How you handle the API requests and the data that you get from them.
- The management of the data and the state of the application. You can use the tool that feels more comfortable, whatever it is Context API, Redux, Recoil, etc. But show understanding of their concepts.
- A small demonstration of testing. It's not necessary to test all the components, but at least show how you would test a component or a hook.
- If you feel short of time, please document the steps that you would have taken to complete the project or what you would have added.
- Creativity. You have the freedom to add any feature, pattern, library, or technique that you feel shows your skills as a developer.
- Extra points if you implement a simple auth formulary, doesn't matter if it's with dummy data, but implement good practices of forms validation.
- Typescript is a must.

## Part 2. Architecture

- As the second part, you have to write in a markdown file into the root of the project, how you will handle a hypothetical situation where you have to scale the application to a bigger one. For example. How you will handle the state, components, routing system or even how it will be integrated with the backend or cloud services.
